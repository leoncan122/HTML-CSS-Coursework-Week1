            <h2>Let's get it!</h2>
            <p>First of all, you will need a skateboard for sure, and if you don't have one,
              just ask a friend or try to get one of second hand on wallapop. Just don't go to the skateshop
              and buy the skateboard whit the highest price, don't be a full.You are at the begin of this
              new life and also you don't know if goint to like it.The only thing that need to work for now are
              the wheels, so verify if them roll whitout problem, and if the table it's not cracked.
              So at this point, you have the 10% of be a skateboarder, and the 90% of going to skate, that it's not the
              same
              thing.</p>

            <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>The first thing if you need to know is that you will hurt, there is no way to don't hut it, is part
              of the learning and practice, so if you have fear, do it whit fear but do it.
              Then when you be ready to mount the beast, just put your the foot that going to be in front of you on the
              beast(table),and then put on the other foot that rest on the floor, that will posicionate on the back side
              of the table, your feet should be over the screws.
              Prove to bend your knees a little or all that you feel comfortable, think that more bended more
              flexibility
              near to the floor, so less injuries and danger.
              When you feel comfortable to push, you must put the backfoot out of the table bend your knees again,
              push forward to the point where the leg is straight, and repeat, and repeat, then you can put your
              backfoot
              again on the table. At this point, on movement, going forward, you body should rotates, so you vision will
              keep seeing the way, but your body is in the same position that your skateboard(table).
              See the photo-reference below.

            <h2>Do an OLLIE.</h2>
            <p>For now the only trick that you need to learn is the Ollie.<br>
              <br>it's a basic thing, and the first, that you should learn. So the first rule is always to start
              and land(finish) a ollie or any other trick, it's BEND YOUR KNEES. this is the first and the last
              step.<br>
              <br>But what's happen in the middle of the transition?...<br><br>Put your backfoot on the tail of the
              beast,
              and the front foot just a little before the screws.<br>
              Whit your knees bended (not your body, keep your head
              in her position, and im saying this because i see a lot of people trying to kiss the floor when they
              prepare to do a trick) you should jump hitting the skateboard whit your backfoot, jump straight(in the
              same
              point),
              and quickly late do a little kick whit the front foot, and flicking your toe and draggin your table
              forward.<br>
              <br>How can i drag my table straight forward?<br>
              <br>Then you jump you must bend again your backfoot in the air, and scrap your table whit your front foot
              flicked.<br>
              <br>This is all about timing and practice, practice, practice and practice.
              <br>If you not get it at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339k4XEvbxY" Target="_blank">here
                is a
                link</a>, to understand what i'm talking about.
